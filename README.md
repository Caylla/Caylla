Hi! ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub Profile!

About Me

ðŸŒ± Hi there! I'm Caylla, a Brazilian Passionate data scientist. My journey into the world of data wasn't exactly planned â€“ it all started with my background in Biology, which led me on a fascinating path. During my master's degree in Ecology, I unexpectedly fell in love with the extensive field of statistics, diving into tools like R and Python along the way.

Since then, I've transformed this newfound passion into my profession. I'm dedicated to staying abreast of the latest trends and developments in the field, always seeking to enhance my skills and make meaningful contributions to challenging and innovative projects.

My journey has been one of continuous learning and growth, and I'm excited to see where it takes me next. Let's connect and explore the endless possibilities of data together! ðŸš€
